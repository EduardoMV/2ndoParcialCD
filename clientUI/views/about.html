                    <p>Welcome to Blackjack! The goal of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.</p>
                    <p>To start, click the "Start Playing" button above. You will be dealt two cards, and the dealer will also receive two cards, one face up and one face down.</p>
                    <p>You can choose to "hit" (receive another card) or "stand" (keep your current hand). Be careful not to exceed 21, as that results in a bust and you lose the round.</p>
                    <p>After you stand, the dealer will reveal their facedown card and draw cards until their hand totals 17 or higher.</p>
                    <p>Whoever has the highest hand value without exceeding 21 wins the round!</p>
